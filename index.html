				Have you ever stumbled upon a YouTube channel that completely
				transformed your perspective on a subject? For me, that transformative
				moment occurred when I discovered "The Coding Train." This channel,
				hosted by Daniel Shiffman, is a treasure trove of coding tutorials and
				creative coding challenges and they ignited my passion for programming,
				also led me to explore more fascinating projects.
			</p>
			<p>
				His videos primarily focused on p5.js, a JavaScript library aimed at
				making coding accessible and fun for creative individuals. I started
				with his "Introduction to p5.js" series, which provided a solid
				foundation for understanding the library's core concepts. Daniel's
				explanations were clear, and his coding challenges were not only
				educational but also incredibly entertaining.
			</p>
			<p>
				Eventually I moved on to learn web development, got a full time job
				which is much more exciting than my previous job as a mechanical
				engineering.
			</p>
			<p>
				Recently, I came accross a vidoe by ThePrimeagen on youtube, where he
				was creating the
				<a

					target="_blank"
					>Conway's game of life (Wikipedia)</a
				>
				using HTMX. The coding train also had a video on it and I decided to
				create that using p5.js. The animation running about is the canvas
				element of HTML, which is being drawn by p5.js.
